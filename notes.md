Had a blast through my CV this morning so thought I’d send you some stuff in case you want to make a start. Plus I could be served notice any day now which frees me up to start looking.

You can play around with the formatting and stuff to make it look cool and professional. For example in the work experience section where there are multiple subheadings. 

Sections I’m going for are in bold and underlined.
